# Membean Synonym Finder
![A screenshot of using the tool](img.png)
A simple tool to find possible membean word replacements in essays. 
It scans each word in the essay, and provides a list of possible membean word synonyms for each one.
Keep in mind that there are many false positives: many words have multiple meaningsâ€”if you blindly follow all the suggestions of this tool without actually knowing what the words mean, you will lose points.
And you will probably deserve it.
## Dependencies
You **must** have python installed in order to run this project. See https://www.python.org/downloads/ for more information.

Beyond that, this project uses two dependencies:
- `termcolor`, to print out nice looking outputs, and
- `pyperclip`, to allow easy input from the clipboard (without this, it's sometimes difficult to paste in a large essay).

However, neither of these dependencies are strictly required, so the following steps may be skipped (albeit with reduced functionality).
### Windows
Replace `path/to/project` with whatever the file path of the `MembeanSynonym` directory is on your device.
```shell
cd path/to/project
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### macOS
Replace `path/to/project` with whatever the file path of the `MembeanSynonym` directory is on your device.
```shell
cd path/to/project
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Linux/Whatever else
You know how to install a `requirements.txt`.
## Usage
To use this tool, run the following:

Note: Replace `path/to/project` with whatever the file path of the `MembeanSynonym` directory is on your device. On macOS, replace all usages of `python` with `python3`.
```shell
cd path/to/project
python main.py
```
### Input
If `pyperclip` is installed, you'll be first prompted for an input mode:
```
How do you want to input your essay (type 'c' to get it from your clipboard; type 'm' to type/paste it in manually)
```
Selecting `m` will allow you to manually input the text to be analyzed. 
Selecting `c` will automatically input whatever has been copied to the clipboard using Ctrl+C (Cmd+C on macOS). 
### Membean Level Selection
This tool can be configured to only use membean words of a specific level or levels. 
To do so, respond with a comma separated list (such as `3, 4, 5`) when prompted:  
```
Which membean levels would you like to include? Enter a comma separated list, or press enter to include words from all levels.
